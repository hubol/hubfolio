<p>An old platform exploration game, mostly inspired by freeware games I had consumed in my youth.</p>
<p>This game suffers from general unfairness, lazy level and boss design, and a lack of mechanics.</p>
<p>I was inspired to improve upon the concept by developing the follow-up, 2.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6fn0eTWvBU&list=PLgDMdsdtqKDstCL_LJPwthUoszUHAZAqE">playthrough was done by raocow</a>, which is probably more entertaining than the game itself.</p>
